Future Todo:
	- Fix the Vulkan API, somehow the configurator thinks you have version 1.2 something. But I installed the 1.3.283 SDK, so? 
		The init_vulkan() require_api_version(1, 3) currently does not work because of it, same with physical device selector.
		I changed this to be desire_api_version and it works for now. This may cause issues.

		This may be fixed by copying these 3 files (https://github.com/charles-lunarg/vk-bootstrap/tree/main/src) into third_party/vkbootstrap/

	- Validation error in console (related to the vulkan api version)
		
		[ERROR: Validation]
		Validation Error: [ VUID-VkDeviceCreateInfo-pNext-pNext ] Object 0: handle = 0x1f4f2164b20, type = VK_OBJECT_TYPE_INSTANCE; 
		| MessageID = 0x901f59ec | vkCreateDevice(): pCreateInfo->pNext includes a pointer to a VkStructureType 
		(VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_VULKAN_1_3_FEATURES) which was added in VK_API_VERSION_1_3 but the current effective API
		version is 1.2.155 (0x0040209b). The Vulkan spec states: Each pNext member of any structure (including this one) in the pNext
		chain must be either NULL or a pointer to a valid struct for extending VkDeviceCreateInfo 
		(https://vulkan.lunarg.com/doc/view/1.3.283.0/windows/1.3-extensions/vkspec.html#VUID-VkDeviceCreateInfo-pNext-pNext)

Previously:
	- [X] Recreated a new project using Vulkan and SDL as opposed to Vulkan and GLFW.		05/06
	- [X] Build the cmake files using cmake-gui.											05/06

	- [X] Follow the code walkthrough tutorial of the vulkan guide							07/06

	- [X] Completed chapter 1 of the vulkan guide, initialising vulkan						08/06

Next time:
	- [ ] Fix issue from chapter 1 (no entry point for vkQueueSubmit2() found)
 	- [ ] Begin chapter 2 of the vulkan guide (https://vkguide.dev/docs/new_vkguide/chapter_2)
