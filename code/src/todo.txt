Future Todo:
	
	- [ ] Optimise the cube primitive rendering (currently 24 vertices, should really only be 8)
	- [ ] Fix the rotation origin point for each render object (currently not around the origin)
	- [ ] Privatise unnecessary variables and provide const correct accessors
	- [ ] Define an error code and proper logging for Fish (i.e. FISH_ERROR, FISH_WARN, FISH_FATAL, FISH_LOG) potentially coloured in the console
	- [ ] Begin implementing the 1.3 API as our currently implementation uses outdated code
	- [ ] Create new folders for different parts (i.e. Backend, Core, Ecs) 
	- [ ] When creating our draw image, set its initial dimensions to be the monitor resolution instead of window extents.
	- [ ] Implement a framework class that refactors the way our engine is loaded (similar to ACL/Tyro)
	`-> Included in this is to refactor the vk_engine class to a fish_vulkan_backend class with classes for individual components.
