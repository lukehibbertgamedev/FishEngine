Future Todo:
	
	- [ ] Optimise the cube primitive rendering (currently 24 vertices, should really only be 8)
	- [ ] Fix the rotation origin point for each render object (currently not around the origin)
	- [ ] Privatise unnecessary variables and provide const correct accessors
	- [ ] Define an error code and proper logging for Fish (i.e. FISH_ERROR, FISH_WARN, FISH_FATAL, FISH_LOG) potentially coloured in the console
	- [ ] Begin implementing the 1.3 API as our currently implementation uses outdated code
	- [ ] Create new folders for different parts (i.e. Backend, Core, Ecs) 
	- [ ] When creating our draw image, set its initial dimensions to be the monitor resolution instead of window extents.

Next time:

	- [!!!!] Refactor to use Vulkan API 1.3 (done), stabilise the branch (doing), merge to dev, create a scenes branch

	- [ ] Fix the cleanup error on window close.

	- [ ] Remove most (if not all) validation errors/warnings in the console.

	- [ ] Implement a simple logger to update throughout important steps in the engine.

	- [ ] Begin refactoring current code to reflect the ECS demo (have current scene objects fall to gravity)

	- [ ] Implement the new scene button functionality
	
	- [ ] Implement the save scene button functionality
	
	- [ ] Implement the load scene button functionality

	- [ ] Implement a framework class that refactors the way our engine is loaded (similar to ACL/Tyro)
	`-> Included in this is to refactor the vk_engine class to a fish_vulkan_backend class with classes for individual components.


	- [ ] Render several different models using different textures (see https://kylehalladay.com/blog/tutorial/vulkan/2018/01/28/Textue-Arrays-Vulkan.html)

	- [ ] Sort the render objects container before rendering by Pipeline and Mesh, reducing number of binds (see Chpt 3)

	- [ ] Go through the console window on termination and attempt to clear the validation errors/warnings
