Ensure CMakeLists.txt is updated per file created:

For each file that you create, CMakeLists.txt needs to know so it can be added to the executable.
This is the one within root/CMakeLists.txt.

Potential optimisation technique - Submit the same command buffer multiple times: 

Record the commands you need once, and submit them to the command queue each frame. 
This is useful to avoid recording commands into the buffer per frame, but for tutorial's sake
we do this anyway as it shows more of a render engine technique.
This is only useful if you are sure that the commands won't be changed on a per-frame basis.
This is a picky technique as recording commands is relatively cheap, but worth noting.

Initialisation of Vulkan structures:

With Vulkan structures, it is very important that we do this `VkCommandPoolCreateInfo commandPoolInfo = {};`
By doing ` = {}`, we are letting the compiler initialize the entire struct to zero. 
This is critical, as in general Vulkan structs will have their defaults set in a way that 0 is 
relatively safe. By doing that, we make sure we don’t leave uninitialized data in the struct.
